#Analysis of Employee Structure and Upcoming Retirements at Pewett Hackard Co.


##Purpose: 
The analysis was done with the goal of identifying how many employees are at Pewett Hackard, as well as the positions they occupy. The data gathered in the analysis will be used to determine the number of vacant positions and employees eligibility for mentorship programs / internal promotions into roles of retiring employees. 


##Results:
Senior Engineers and Senior Staff make up the vast majority of eligible retirees at Pewett Hackard (25916 and 24926 respectively), followed by engineers (9285), staff (7636), Technique Leaders (3603), Assistant Managers (1090) and Managers (2), totalling 72458 potentially vacant positions. 1549 employees internally are eligible for mentorship program, leaving 70909 potential additional vacancies. Employees that are engineers, regardless of level or tenure, make up most of the retiring staff.  Engineers at all levels will need to be hired in order to fill the inevitable gaps which will be left after these retirements. Two new managers are needed; 1 per department. 


##Summary: 
There are 72458 employees who qualify for retirement that will need their roles filled. 1549 employees qualify for mentorship / internal promotion. Out of 1549 candidates for the mentorship program, 529 are senior engineers, 596 are senior staff, 190 are engineers, 155 are staff, 29 are assistant engineers, and 77 are technique leaders. There should be sufficient soon-to-retire employees ready to train both those who need mentorship and new-hires. Every department has more soon-to-retire employees than they do employees ready for mentorship / internal promotion, which indicates a strong capacity to take on new hires.
